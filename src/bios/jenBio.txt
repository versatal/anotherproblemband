Jen's Bio- Born and raised in Bay City, Michigan, I remember listening to my sister’s albums full blast on the headphones. Thanks much to my sister and some friends, 
I’ve had a large range of music influences such as The Beatles, Sex Pistols, Black Sabbath, The Monkees, Rush, Wings, Iron Maiden, Simon and Garfunkle and Chopin. 
I started playing piano about 4 years old, learning to read music as I learned to read books. At 17, I bought my 1st bass, influenced by a bass player with whom my sister roomed. 
About a year later, I bought an electric guitar. I took some lessons, learned from other musicians and taught myself to play over the years. While taking classes at a community college, 
I met up with my friend Ox, and then hooked up with Trent and John to form the original band. During our break away from each other, I played with other bands/ musicians off and on before 
reuniting with the guys. We then set up studio at my house, where I now live with my husband (Roadie Joe) and 4 dogs. I love rock, but have a penchant for punk and folk music and enjoy a 
wide variety of artists including Green Day, The Cure, Gordon Lightfoot, Ozzy/ Black Sabbath, The Monkees, and Rich Mullins. I also love Rogers and Hammersteins musicals and Opera. My most 
memorable musical experience was seeing Ozzy in concert, re-united with the original Black Sabbath members. In my free time, I spend time with our dogs and husband, helping rescue animals, 
studying for vet school and fighting BSL. Interests outside of music include painting/ drawing, horseback riding, reading (fantasy/ sci-fi and English literature), 
RPG, Crocheting and Zombies.
